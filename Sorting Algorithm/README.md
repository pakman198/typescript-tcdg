## Sorting Algorithm Project

In this project we try to create a class that can sort different types of data:
* Collections of numbers
* Collections of strings
* Collections of linked lists

The goal is that it doesn't matter what kind of data you pass to the class, you can sort it with a single class instead of having to create different classes to handle the sorting.

It uses inheritance and abstract classes.
